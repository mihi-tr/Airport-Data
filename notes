Conversion Thoughts:
SQL is faster than pure python, even non optimized SQLite (so use sqlite
for most operations, python to wrap it up).

If the data could be parallelized there would be better performance on
multi-processor platforms. Unfortunately sqlite3 in python doesn't do the
trick... Maybe we can do something different.
